# FCC Responsive Web Design Projects

Just to show the projects I made for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. The course focuses on teaching HTML5, CSS3 and how to design responsive webpages from zero, no frameworks and no JavaScript.

The projects can be visualized on my [CodePen's collection](https://codepen.io/collection/rxemqV) or by clicking on my [certification (automatically) issued by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/1898Angelo/responsive-web-design)
